Exploit YouTube Algorithm 2024

Hello, first of all I would like to clarify that I am making this post with the aim of fixing this exploit or bug, which causes YouTube video views to freeze, my English is not very good but I will try to make myself understood.
How it works:

First of all you have to be subscribed to the channel you want to harm (1 or 2 hours before doing this), I recommend having notifications activated since this way it acts quickly after the video is uploaded, drastically affecting views and income. Second step, watch the newly uploaded video for about 30 seconds, so that the system detects us as a user, after this unsubscribe (unsubscribe from the channel) and dislike the aforementioned video.
What effect does this have?:

A few minutes after performing these actions, views will begin to fall, completely freezing the traffic of the video and the channel itself, imagine the impact of performing these actions on each of the future videos that our target uploads.
Why is this happening?:

Since covid, YouTube engineers implemented an automatic system that determines if a video is "good" or "bad" and by performing these actions the system determines not to send 100% of notifications to subscribers and not to show your video on the home page or next, losing hundreds or thousands of views (depending on the size of the channel).
Why am I making this public?:

The reality is that believe it or not, YouTube workers themselves are corrupt, and they have leaked part of how their magnificent algorithm works, I'm not saying all of them but I do have several documented cases that are already waiting for the lawsuit to come out.
What is the objective of this?:

For my part, I hope that by making this exploit public, which I have had to experience and lose thousands of $, people start to exploit it and thus YouTube engineers will fix it.
Why don't you report it and end it sooner?:

I can guarantee that this has been reported more than 30 times (on my own channel) and they fix it for 3 days, maximum a week, after which the views freeze again.

Greetings//
